All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Phase1.17.7] - 2025-08-30

### Core Changes
- **DuckDB Details Path**: Implemented `get_group_details_duckdb()` for efficient per-group querying with strict column projection
- **Cache Key Updates**: Added backend parameter to all cache keys (`build_cache_key` and `build_details_cache_key`)
- **Force DuckDB**: When `use_duckdb_for_groups: true`, skip PyArrow entirely for groups list
- **Backend Persistence**: Store backend choice per run in session state
- **Page Size Default**: Reduced default page size to 50 for better performance

### Technical Implementation
- **Details Projection**: Only load columns shown in details UI (`account_name`, `account_id`, `Disposition`, `is_primary`, `weakest_edge_to_primary`, `suffix`)
- **Cache Management**: Added "Clear Caches for Current Run" button for selective cache clearing
- **Timing Logs**: Detailed DuckDB timing for details fetch (connect, query, pandas conversion)
- **Fallback Support**: PyArrow fallback for details when DuckDB unavailable

### Performance Targets
- **List Fetch**: < 3s for 50 groups using DuckDB
- **Details Fetch**: < 1s for first group details
- **No Page Blocking**: Details loading should not cause full-page grey overlay

### Files Modified
- `src/utils/ui_helpers.py`: Added DuckDB details functions, updated cache keys
- `app/main.py`: Force DuckDB backend, cache management UI
- `config/settings.yaml`: Updated page size defaults

### Fixed
- **Pandas Array Truthiness Error**: Fixed "The truth value of an empty array is ambiguous" error in `get_group_details_lazy` function by using explicit length checks instead of boolean context for pandas Series
- **Truly Lazy Expanders**: Fixed eager loading of expander details by implementing button-triggered lazy loading for "Explain Metadata" and "Cross-links" sections

- **Performance Optimization**: Eliminated dozens of unnecessary group detail loads on initial page render by making expanders truly lazy
- **Truly Lazy Group Loading**: Fixed performance issue where all group details were loaded eagerly on page render - now only loads minimal header info initially, with full details loaded on-demand via "Load Group Details" button
- **TypeError Fix**: Fixed `TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'` in `load_stage_state` function by adding proper null checks for `start_time` and `end_time`
- **Logging Optimization**: Reduced excessive logging in `get_run_metadata` and `format_run_display_name` functions to prevent log spam when loading run dropdowns
- **Run Deletion Error Fix**: Fixed `MediaFileStorageError` that occurred when deleting runs by clearing Streamlit's internal cache (`st.cache_data.clear()` and `st.cache_resource.clear()`) before `st.rerun()`
- **Robust Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks around data loading to gracefully handle cases where cached data becomes invalid after run deletion
- **Import Conflict Fix**: Fixed `UnboundLocalError` by removing redundant `import streamlit as st` statements that conflicted with the existing import at the top of the file
