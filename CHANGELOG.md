## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-27

### Added

- **Manual blacklist editor**: Add/remove pattern-based rules for automatic Delete classification
- **Audit trail**: Timestamps and export functionality for manual changes
- **Better group layout**: Group info moved to top with badges, improved table readability

### Changed

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-27

### Added
- **Conservative alias extraction** (semicolon, numbered sequences; parentheses only when content contains a legal suffix or multiple capitalized words)
- **Alias matching** with high-confidence gating (suffix match + score â‰¥ high), cross-links only; writes `alias_matches.parquet` and minimal metadata to `review_ready.csv`
- **Minimal UI** support: alias badge/expander and "Has aliases" filter in Streamlit
- **Performance safeguards** for alias comparisons (config cap)

### Changed
- Parentheses handling is **preserved and flagged** by default (no blanket alias creation)
