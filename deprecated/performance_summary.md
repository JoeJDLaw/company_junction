# Performance Testing Results

## Overview
Performance testing was conducted on the legacy and optimized alias matching paths using three dataset sizes: 1k, 5k, and 10k records. The tests measured total pipeline runtime, memory usage, and alias matching stage performance.

## Results by Dataset Size

### 1k Dataset
- **Total Runtime**
  - Legacy: 9.93s
  - Optimized: 9.19s
  - Speedup: 1.1x
- **Alias Stage**
  - Legacy: 1.65s
  - Optimized: 0.83s
  - Speedup: 2.0x
- **Memory Usage**: Comparable between both paths
- **Match Counts**: Identical results (0 alias matches)

### 5k Dataset
- **Total Runtime**
  - Legacy: 109.19s
  - Optimized: 95.48s
  - Speedup: 1.1x
- **Alias Stage**
  - Legacy: 18.39s
  - Optimized: 5.12s
  - Speedup: 3.6x
- **Memory Usage**: Comparable between both paths
- **Match Counts**: Identical results (50 alias matches)

### 10k Dataset
- **Total Runtime**
  - Legacy: 258.67s
  - Optimized: 205.56s
  - Speedup: 1.3x
- **Alias Stage**
  - Legacy: 61.49s
  - Optimized: 9.53s
  - Speedup: 6.5x
- **Memory Usage**: Comparable between both paths
- **Match Counts**: Identical results (303 alias matches)

## Key Findings

1. **Alias Stage Optimization**
   - The optimized path shows significant speedup in the alias matching stage
   - Speedup factor increases with dataset size (2.0x → 3.6x → 6.5x)
   - Demonstrates excellent scaling characteristics

2. **Total Pipeline Performance**
   - Modest but consistent overall speedup (1.1x - 1.3x)
   - Improvement more noticeable with larger datasets
   - Other pipeline stages show similar performance between paths

3. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Both paths show similar memory usage patterns
   - No significant memory overhead from optimization
   - Peak memory usage scales linearly with dataset size

4. **Result Correctness**
   - Identical match counts between legacy and optimized paths
   - Consistent group counts and dispositions
   - Validates optimization preserves accuracy

## Scaling Characteristics

The optimized path shows improved scaling with dataset size:

1. **Alias Stage Scaling**
   - Legacy: Roughly quadratic (1.65s → 18.39s → 61.49s)
   - Optimized: More linear (0.83s → 5.12s → 9.53s)
   - Gap widens significantly at larger scales

2. **Total Runtime Scaling**
   - Legacy: ~26x increase from 1k to 10k
   - Optimized: ~22x increase from 1k to 10k
   - Better scaling characteristics for larger datasets

## Readiness Assessment

Based on these results, the optimized path demonstrates:
1. Consistent correctness across all test sizes
2. Significant performance improvements, especially in alias matching
3. Better scaling characteristics for larger datasets
4. No memory efficiency penalties

The implementation appears ready for the full 94k dataset, with the following projections:
- Expected alias stage speedup: >6.5x
- Estimated total runtime improvement: ~1.4-1.5x
- Memory usage expected to scale linearly

## Recommendations

1. Proceed with 94k dataset testing
2. Monitor memory usage during larger scale runs
3. Consider additional optimization opportunities in other pipeline stages
4. Implement performance monitoring for production deployment
